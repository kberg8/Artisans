					<h2>Our Partnerships</h2>
					<p>Education is key to the success of our employment programs. Many members of the community have misconceptions and fears about individuals with intellectual disabilities. Through our efforts to develop employment opportunities in the community for our clients, we strive first and foremost to help employers understand hiring a person with a disability should not be seen as a charitable obligation. A person should be hired, whether he or she has a disability, based on grounds that he or she can perform the required job duties for that position.</p>

					<p>Artisans is set apart from its competitors as it is the largest Group Supported Employment provider in Spokane County. Artisans has taken creative avenues and approaches to develop group job sites in the community. One approach has been the development of several work contracts with local businesses, such as Waste Management and Pepsi Co., 2nd Harvest Food Bank, Earthworks Recycling, Saranac Building and Community Building. The other is the development of mobile work crews that are managed in house which offer landscaping, janitorial, vending and recycling services to commercial businesses as well as residential customers. </p>

					<p>One of our work crews has been employed by the Pepsi Bottling Co. for more than six years assisting with sorting and processing of damaged products. Mike Duquette, Product Availability Manager, states that having the Artisans work crew at the Pepsi “…has added value to our lives. I can tell you that because they want to do a good job, they like what they do and we enjoy them being here.”   The work they do saves the company on average more than 10,000 cases of product each year. </p>

					<p>Through our Individual Employment program we support our clients in finding competitive employment positions in the community. We offer training support to a client as long as needed, which helps alleviate the responsibility of the hiring company to offer the extra training hours as well as provide ongoing support after initial training is completed. Our staff will go through the training process with the client hired in the position to ensure any extra training and coaching our staff provides will be in line with the company’s standards and expectations. Some of the businesses who have hired our clients are Trader Joe’s, Walmart, Safeway, Timber Creek Grill Buffett, Office Depot and 14th and Grand Salon. </p>
