					<h2>Overview of Artisans</h2>
					<p>Artisans strives to provide each of our clients the services necessary to ensure employment goals can be accomplished and provide stable and supportive work environments.  Artisans provides employment and community access services for persons with intellectual and physical disabilities.</p>

					<p>Each client The Artisans serves is a unique individual with specific skills, abilities and talents. Because of this, our agency prides itself in offering services and employment opportunities as diversified as those that make up our organization. </p>

					<p>Artisans’ ability to transform to meet the needs of our clients, innovative job developing techniques and dedicated board members and staff are key components for our continued success. Over the years, The Artisans has grown, established many strong employer and community relationships through all of its programs and is the largest Group Supported Employment provider in Spokane County. </p>

					<h2>History of Artisans</h2>
					<p>Artisans has been a proud partner of the Spokane Community since 1987.  Our services continually transform to meet the needs of our clients.  The Artisans began as an agency whose employment offerings centered around on-site woodwork.  Over the past 25 years, however, The Artisans has grown and undergone many changes.</p>

					<p>In 2004 Artisans began to take a new direction that emphasized community-based employment.  Now our clients work in community-based jobs providing various services for private and commercial employers.  The Artisans began providing employment services for less than 10 adults with disabilities, and today provides employment support for more than 100 individuals.  The Artisans provides job developing and coaching to persons with disabilities for both Individual and Group Supported Employment, and Community Access services.</p>
